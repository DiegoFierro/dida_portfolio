        <section id="tribute-info">
            <p><strong>Los Prisioneros</strong> ("The Prisoners") are widely considered the most representative group in the history of Chilean rock. Their austere music, lacking virtuoso pretensions, and lyrics filled with sharp social observation, became the soundtrack of youth disillusionment during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Today, their relevance persists, defining them as classics. Songs like "La voz de los '80" (The Voice of the '80s), "El baile de los que sobran" (The Dance of the Leftovers), "Tren al sur" (Train to the South), and "Sexo" (Sex) rose as anti-system, revolutionary, and defiant anthems. Various internal crises led them through two distinct eras and several breakups, until their final dissolution in 2006. Despite the band being long dissolved, their songs continue to resonate across nearly all generations of the Chilean public.</p>

            <h2>Origin and Early Steps</h2>
            <p>Despite the strong political impact of Los Prisioneros, the band originated entirely removed from partisan or ideological questioning. Its members—Jorge González (vocals and bass), Claudio Narea (guitar), and Miguel Tapia (drums)—met as classmates in 1979 when they entered the first year of high school at Liceo number 6 Andrés Bello, in the commune of San Miguel.</p>
            <p>The trio's friendship solidified through music, leading to two projects that preceded the band's birth: Los Pseudopillos (The Pseudo-rascals), a kind of playful, rap-themed band centered around González and Narea; and Los Vinchukas, the true precursor, where they first used homemade and second-hand instruments to play live at high school events. Finally, on July 1, 1983, they debuted as Los Prisioneros at Liceo Miguel León Prado.</p>
            <p>That same year, after graduating from high school, Jorge González began studying Sound Engineering at the University of Chile. There he met Carlos Fonseca, the son of a well-off family who also managed Fusión, a record store in the Providencia neighborhood. Within a few weeks, Fonseca dropped out of his studies to dedicate himself to the store and a couple of projects that consumed his free hours: a music column in Mundo-Diners magazine and a weekly contemporary sounds program on Radio Beethoven.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Jorge González was conceiving the trio's songs, while also dropping out of university to immerse himself in his role as leader, composer, and soul of Los Prisioneros. Contacted by a mutual friend from the Faculty of Arts—the future Aparato Raro, Igor Rodríguez—González reconnected with Fonseca, who asked for his band's songs to play on his radio show.</p>
            <p>The material González provided was so rudimentary that they had to re-record all the songs on the second floor of Fusión. Not content with that, they rented an old studio on Lira Street, belonging to Pancho Straub, where they recorded a dozen tracks that were played on Fonseca's program and helped them gain a foothold in alternative circles.</p>
            <p>During 1984, Fonseca decided to become the trio's manager and, with them, inaugurate the nascent Chilean rock movement that would dominate the second half of the decade. That year, Los Prisioneros caused a sensation at university gigs at the University of Chile and the Catholic University; however, they were not understood within their own social circles. Paradoxically, it was these "preppy" or "intellectual" circles, which they so abhorred, who were the first to champion them and elevate them as idols of a progressive movement against the regime. Unwittingly, Los Prisioneros became the standard-bearers of a struggle against the dictatorship that they never truly cared about, at least in those early years.</p>

            <h2>The Phenomenon and Consolidation</h2>
            <p>Assessing the fervor their group was causing, Fonseca understood it was time to channel it with an album release. Thus, on December 13, 1984, <em>La voz de los ´80</em> (The Voice of the '80s), a cassette with the label of the newly opened Fusión production company, went on sale. Recorded under the clear musical influence of The Clash, it established them as leaders of the emerging musical movement in the country, fueled by the pop invasion arriving from Argentina, especially after the Falklands War.</p>
            <p>By mid-1985, the multinational EMI managed to overcome its self-censorship and signed a distribution agreement with Fusión for the album to be distributed throughout Chile. EMI's powerful machinery spread their name from Arica to Punta Arenas. Songs like "Sexo" (Sex) and "La voz de los 80" (The Voice of the '80s) invaded radio programming, opening spaces for new local bands that would star in the so-called Latin pop boom of the '80s. The definitive consolidation of Los Prisioneros came on November 1, 1986, when they released the album <em>Pateando piedras</em> (Kicking Stones) with two sold-out concerts at Estadio Chile. That album, already under EMI license, included the song "El baile de los que sobran" (The Dance of the Leftovers), a song about marginalized youth after leaving formal education, which became an anthem across the continent.</p>
            <p><em>Pateando piedras</em> (Kicking Stones) marked the band's great leap to mass popularity, the battering ram that allowed them to overcome the censorship imposed by the authorities who banned them from television and media controlled by the dictatorship. Intelligent lyrics on social issues, a danceable sound enriched with electronic components, and the acidity of leader González before the press and public definitively distinguished them as the most striking and interesting expression of rock of those years. Songs like "Quieren dinero" (They Want Money), "Por qué los ricos" (Why the Rich), or "Muevan las industrias" (Move the Industries) contained accurate social criticisms, were danceable, and represented a good part of the youth of those years.</p>
            <p>All this, however, came at a cost. The press made them suspicious at first, and then dangerous, for the status quo encouraged by the dictatorship. Therefore, unintentionally and pushed by the system itself, Los Prisioneros were forced to define themselves politically in response to current events. In 1987, during an extensive tour of the south of the country, their concerts began to be banned by military garrisons, an event that led to their third album, <em>La cultura de la basura</em> (The Culture of Trash, released in December of that year), being released without a promotional tour due to government boycott.</p>
            <p>That album, dedicated to the AM radio culture that marked them personally and artistically, was a resounding economic failure and is the least appreciated by the band itself. Less polished in its sound, <em>La cultura de la basura</em> (The Culture of Trash) incorporated for the first time songs by Tapia and Narea, maintaining the sharpness of González's lyrics, though with a greater electronic presence. These elements barely transcended given the album's limited diffusion, and the distance with the media intensified when the band publicly called to vote NO in the plebiscite on Pinochet's continuity.</p>

            <h2>The Breakup and the Hiatus</h2>
            <p>With public venues forbidden, the trio spent 1988 consolidating their fame in the markets of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia. They conducted tours and gigs in all three countries, achieving the greatest impact in the latter. Three consecutive tours (September and November '88, and April '89) were the result of the group's impact in the coffee-growing country.</p>
            <p>But at the height of their boom and internationalization, the breakup occurred. By late 1989, amidst the preparation of the album <em>Corazones</em> (Hearts), the musical differences between Narea and González became insurmountable. Narea, leaning towards rock and roll, and the leader, seduced by electronics, ended their relationship amidst a bitter dispute aggravated by romantic entanglements, which left the band as a duo that presented its fourth production in May 1990.</p>
            <p><em>Corazones</em> (Hearts) was Los Prisioneros' most successful album and technically their best-produced, recorded and mixed in Los Angeles, California, by Argentine producer Gustavo Santaolalla (with Jorge González alone due to Tapia's inability to travel due to visa issues). A collection of painful love songs and a strong presence of synthesizers defined this album, for whose promotional tour two new musicians were invited to the band: former Cleopatras member Cecilia Aguayo, and former Banda 69 guitarist Robert Rodríguez.</p>
            <p>In 1991, Los Prisioneros arrived at the first Viña del Mar Festival in democracy, a more symbolic event than anything else, because the band no longer had the combative face of other times. From there, a farewell tour continued throughout the country, during which there was no shortage of harsh dialogues with the public. At the end of that tour, the history of the most important band in Chilean rock history came to an end. The decision was definitive and was believed to be so throughout the decade that followed their farewell.</p>
            <p>During the hiatus, each member of Los Prisioneros pursued their own musical paths. Claudio Narea formed Profetas y Frenéticos (Prophets and Frenetics), a band he worked with intermittently until 1996; Miguel Tapia maintained the ambiguous career of Jardín Secreto (Secret Garden); and Jorge González embarked on a solo career that began with huge promotional campaigns but ended with explorations in electronic music and proposals quite far from their former mass appeal. The three only reunited at the instance of the compilation album <em>Ni por la razón, ni por la fuerza</em> (Neither by Reason, Nor by Force), which EMI released with singles and rarities in 1996.</p>
            <p>Although on that occasion they played a concert without an audience in a rehearsal room at the Balmaceda 1215 center, the possibility of reuniting was discarded; and the distance intensified in 1998, when Tapia and González joined Venezuelan Argenis Brito for the project Los Dioses (The Gods), with which they performed some not-so-fortunate gigs, recreating the San Miguel trio's repertoire under a tour subtitled "Lo mejor de Los Prisioneros" (The Best of Los Prisioneros). González's aggressiveness and his lack of care on stage alienated the audience and buried that path shortly after.</p>
            <p>The release of a collective tribute to Los Prisioneros, produced by Carlos Fonseca, and the album <em>El cassette pirata</em> (The Pirate Cassette, with live recordings) only exacerbated the differences between the former bandmates. But in 2001, things calmed down. Jorge González's return from a drug detoxification period in Cuba led him to gradual approaches to his old core of friends, including his former manager.</p>
            <p>After social gatherings, in March the agreement to reunite solidified, and in July rehearsals began, which two months later materialized in a single: "Las sierras eléctricas" (The Electric Saws, a song already included in the compilation <em>Ni por la razón, ni por la fuerza</em>). The rumor, then, was confirmed: Los Prisioneros, with their original lineup, were back.</p>

            <h2>The Second Era and the Definitive End</h2>
            <p>On October 9, 2001, the band held its first press conference, with all three members announcing a massive concert at the central Coliseum of the Estadio Nacional (National Stadium) and the production of an album with new material. The call, in any case, was a huge success, and the band had to extend their performance to two nights due to excess demand. On November 30 and December 1 of that year, Los Prisioneros gathered a total of 140,000 people for two nearly three-hour concerts where they reviewed a good part of their 80s repertoire.</p>
            <p>Throughout 2002, the band continued working, toured Chile and abroad, and released an album and a DVD with the performances at the Estadio Nacional. In May of the following year, after performing at the Viña del Mar Festival, they premiered the first original song since <em>Corazones</em> (Hearts): "Ultraderecha" (Far Right), a danceable irony about Chilean political right, and a preview of the eponymous album released that same year.</p>
            <p>During the promotion of that work, which sold more than 40,000 copies and received mixed reviews, a new crisis radically twisted the group's fate. In September, the departure of Claudio Narea was reported. It was the guitarist who made the reasons public after a final concert (in Coquimbo). In an open letter sent to the media, the musician denounced having been fired from the trio and having had to promote an album that he had never liked. González refused to comment on his statements as soon as he faced the press again, during a press conference that was supposed to introduce Álvaro Henríquez as the replacement guitarist (and which ended with the press microphones thrown to the ground by the band's angry leader).</p>
            <p>Their next album was recorded the day after the conference, in a recording made by Los Prisioneros with Henríquez and Pablo Ilabaca from Chancho en Piedra (Stone Pig), as part of the "Raras Tocatas Nuevas" (Rare New Gigs) program on "Rock&Pop" radio. There they revisited their own songs and others (from Los Gatos, Los Iracundos, The Beatles, and Knack, among others), and although the album was excellently produced, it had a low impact on sales. Since then, the brand-new trio, which had to face more than a few criticisms from their followers and the press, began a tour in Mexico and upon their return culminated their mini-tour in a concert in Santiago with Café Tacuba and Angel Parra Trío, with very low attendance, in stark contrast to the mass appeal the group had shown until recently.</p>
            <p>Their activity then focused outside Chile and on the preparation of a new album. <em>Manzana</em> (Apple, 2004) was released with a new lineup: Sergio Coti Badilla on keyboards; and Gonzalo Yáñez (formerly of No me Acuerdo - I Don't Remember) on guitar, after Álvaro Henríquez's silent and unexplained departure. The single "El muro" (The Wall), then, songs with social content and, this time, of love, justified an intimate launch in Santiago and the decision to centralize their career in Mexico. From late 2004, the quartet remained based in that country, amidst an open choice to distance themselves from the Chilean public, who partly had not forgiven Narea's departure nor seemed to empathize with the group's new repertoire. Therefore, the band performed rarely in Chilean territory.</p>
            <p>In that complex scenario, the trio tried to write a new chapter in their history, but the effort gradually began to dissipate. Only González settled in Mexico, while his bandmates remained in Santiago, and their long-time manager, Carlos Fonseca, resigned from the group in late 2004.</p>
            <p>In late 2005, the band announced that they would not record new material and would only perform live. With that decision, and amidst their well-known hermeticism, Los Prisioneros continued their tours in different Latin American countries, on an activity schedule that was only known in Chile through foreign media or the band's website.</p>
            <p>It was through those channels that news of Los Prisioneros' end arrived one summer. After performing at the La Serena Festival, the group traveled to do a brief show in Caracas, Venezuela, where they experienced a tense episode: In a dressing room, while the audience called for their return to the stage, González informed the concert promoter that they would not go back on stage, for a powerful reason: The band had broken up. The end came on February 18, 2006.</p>
